# DESCRIPTION
In cloud computing environments, virtualization technology is used to create       
Virtual Machines (VMs), which can host and execute workflows composed of          
dependent tasks. To optimize the utilization of available resources, it is        
important to schedule these workflows efficiently. The task scheduling problem    
involves assigning the dependent tasks of a workflow to the available VMs on      
the cloud, while minimizing the total completion time or other objective          
functions. 

However, the task scheduling problem in cloud computing is known       
to be NP-hard, which means that finding an optimal solution can be                
computationally infeasible for large-scale problems. To overcome this             
challenge, optimization algorithms such as genetic algorithms, particle           
swarm optimization, and simulated annealing have been proposed in the            
literature. However, these algorithms may suffer in performance when              
dealing with medium and high-dimensional optimization problems. 

To address this challenge, the scheduling process can be modelled as a minimization          
problem with two objectives: computation and data transmission costs. The         
computation cost represents the total execution time of the workflow, while       
the data transmission cost represents the total amount of data transferred        
between the VMs. To optimize this multi-objective problem, a variety of           
algorithms can be used, including the DGWO (Discrete Grey Wolf Optimizer)         
algorithm. 

The DGWO algorithm is a recent metaheuristic optimization              
algorithm that is based on the social behaviour of grey wolves. This algorithm    
has been shown to perform well in a variety of optimization problems,             
including job scheduling, task allocation, and feature selection. By using        
the DGWO algorithm to solve the workflow scheduling problem, it is possible       
to achieve better performance than traditional optimization algorithms,           
particularly for medium and high-dimensional problems.                            

# CONCLUSION
The proposed algorithm was experimentally tested and compared to two well-known   
optimization-based scheduling algorithms (PSO, GWO) using two types of workflows: 
balanced and imbalanced workflows.                                                

The overall experimental results on balanced workflows suggest that DGWO          
performs better than GWO and PSO when applied to various data sizes.             
PSO has the worst performance compared to the other algorithms, especially for    
small population sizes.                                                           

The overall experimental results conducted on imbalanced workflows indicate       
more clearly that DGWO performs better than GWO and PSO. This means that GWO      
and PSO require more computations to produce comparable results to DGWO.          

In conclusion, the DGWO algorithm is a powerful and effective optimization        
technique for scheduling tasks on the cloud.                                      

By using a combination of hunting and social behavior inspired by gray wolves,    
the algorithm is able to efficiently explore the search space and find high-      
quality solutions that minimize the makespan of the workflow.                     

The dynamic adjustment of the number of wolves in each position during the        
search process also allows the algorithm to adapt to the uncertainties in the     
cloud environment and improve the quality of the solutions found.                 

Overall, the DGWO algorithm provides a promising approach to addressing the       
complex and challenging problem of scheduling workflows in the cloud, which is    
essential for optimizing the performance and efficiency of cloud computing        
systems. 

With further research and development, this algorithm has the potential  
to contribute significantly to the field of cloud computing and data analytics.
